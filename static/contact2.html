        <p class="card-text">The association with symbolism and meaning in the colors of lilies has a long and storied history. The association with symbolism and meaning in the colors of lilies can be traced back all the way to ancient times. Lilies figured particularly prominently in ancient mythology, too. For example, the Ancient Greeks viewed the lily as having come directly from the milk of Hera, who was the queen of the Greek Gods. As a result, the lily was a flower that was so revered by the Ancient Greeks.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Like potatoes, tomatoes, and corn, the cheerful plants didn't originate in Europe. They were cultivated in North America as far back as 3000 BCE, when they were developed for food, medicine, dye, and oil. Then, they were exported to the rest of the world by Spanish conquistadors around 1500.</p>
